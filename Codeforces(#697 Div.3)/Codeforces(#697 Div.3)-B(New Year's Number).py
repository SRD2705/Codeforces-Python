Polycarp remembered the 2020-th year, and he is happy with the arrival of the new 2021-th year.
To remember such a wonderful moment,
Polycarp wants to represent the number n as the sum of a certain number of 2020 and a certain number of 2021.

For example, if:

n=4041, then the number n can be represented as the sum 2020+2021;
n=4042, then the number n can be represented as the sum 2021+2021;
n=8081, then the number n can be represented as the sum 2020+2020+2020+2021;
n=8079, then the number n cannot be represented as the sum of the numbers 2020 and 2021.
Help Polycarp to find out whether the number n can be represented as the sum of a certain number of numbers 2020 and
a certain number of numbers 2021.

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤106) — the number that Polycarp wants to
represent as the sum of the numbers 2020 and 2021.

Output
For each test case, output on a separate line:

"YES" if the number n is representable as the sum of a certain number of 2020 and a certain number of 2021;
"NO" otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).
